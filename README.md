Dashboard is the web UI that allows users to interact with paralus. Built using react, the dashboard is responsive, fast and feature loaded. It allows you to easily work with your clusters. The intuitive UI helps you manage your organization, projects and clusters along with user permissions and access. It makes importing clusters and managing access to it easier and quicker.

## Development Setup

### Setup Paralus core

Follow the [development setup guide](https://github.com/paralus/paralus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup) to start Paralus core. The dashboard requires core to be running.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start Dashboard Development Server

```bash
yarn run start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to access the dashboard.

### Setup Admin User Account

Run following command inside root directory of `paralus/paralus`:

```go
go run scripts/initialize/main.go \
        --org DefaultOrg \
        --partner DefaultPartner \
        --partner-host paralus.local \
        --admin-email admin@paralus.local \
        --admin-first-name Admin \
        --admin-last-name User
```

You will get the admin account password set link, like this:

```bash
Org Admin signup URL:  http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/recovery?flow=7c85618b-cc38-4f4f-895c-3540f1fe5149&token=sf7fHWXDW664Y1DAMg5QIJ6Hqg97Huu7
```

Open link in browser and set the password.

Now you can login to the dashboard using email (`admin@paralus.local`) and password you have provided.
